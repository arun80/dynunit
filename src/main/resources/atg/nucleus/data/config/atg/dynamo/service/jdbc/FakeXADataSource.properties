#-------------------------------------------------------------------
#-------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is a non-XA DataSource that creates simulated XAConnections.
# It is useful when a true XADataSource cannot be obtained.  Note that
# the behaviour of the Connections will not be that of normal
# XAConnections, i.e. they will not be able to participate in
# two-phase commits in the true two-phase commit style.
